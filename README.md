# Ada Division by Zero Example
This repository demonstrates a common runtime error in Ada: division by zero.  The `bug.ada` file contains code that attempts to divide by zero, resulting in a `Constraint_Error` exception. The `solution.ada` file shows how to handle this exception gracefully using an exception handler.

## How to Run

1.  Save the provided Ada code in files named `bug.ada` and `solution.ada`.
2.  Compile and run the code using an Ada compiler (like GNAT).
